//! `diec-server` is the HTTP/JSON scan service layer (ADR 0017).
//!
//! It is a thin adapter over `diec-engine`, providing:
//! - `GET /health` — service status and version info
//! - `POST /scan/path` — scan a local file by path
//! - `POST /scan/bytes` — scan uploaded file content
//!
//! The service layer never duplicates detection logic. It delegates to
//! `diec_engine::scan_bytes` for each request. The `Database` is loaded
//! once at startup and shared via `Arc`, avoiding repeated rule loading
//! (the main cost in CLI subprocess invocation).
//!
//! Runtime reuse (ADR 0016 `Scanner`) requires a dedicated worker thread
//! because `RquickjsRuntime` is `!Send`. This is a future optimization;
//! the current server already eliminates the per-process database load
//! cost, which is the primary overhead in batch CLI invocation.
//!
//! See `docs/design/decisions/0017-scan-service-layer.md` for the full
//! design and security boundary.
